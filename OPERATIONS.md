# Operations runbook — OFAC Country KYC Compliance

## Release gate

Run `npm ci`, `npm run verify:repository`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Both GitHub workflows must be green. Confirm that `public/deployment.json` exactly matches the root deployment record and that the production build contains no enabled demo mode.

## Before opening the app

1. Select Midnight **Preview** in the wallet.
2. Confirm contract `kyc_check` and its address against `deployment.json`.
3. Confirm the wallet has sufficient NIGHT/DUST and is synchronized.
4. Load every proving/verifier asset from `public/midnight/kyc_check`.
5. Execute one low-risk canary call and retain its finalized transaction ID.

## Health signals

Watch wallet detection, indexer connectivity, proving-asset HTTP failures, proof generation duration, rejected/partial transactions, and stale public ledger state. Diagnostics must exclude private inputs.

## Incident response

Stop automated decisions, capture the list version and finalized transaction evidence, escalate to compliance review, and do not log raw passport data.

Recovery is complete only after the configured deployment validates, a canary transaction finalizes successfully, ledger state is read from the chain, CI is green, and the incident record contains no private data.

## Rollback

Roll back the frontend to the last green owner-authored release. A frontend rollback does not roll back ledger state. Contract changes require a new independent deployment and a deliberate update to all deployment evidence.
